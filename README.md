### What is SugarRecord?
SugarRecord is a CoreData management library to make it easier work with CoreData. Thanks to SugarRecord you'll be able to start the CoreData stack structure just with a line of code and start working with your database models using closures thanks to the fact that SugarRecord is completly written in Swift.
