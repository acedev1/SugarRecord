    <p>Where the age of all our users is incremented by 1. Notice how in this case the beginWriting() and endWriting() are executed in the context before beginning with all the items and after finishing the edition of <strong>all</strong> the items.</p>
<h3 id="talking-about-contexts">Talking about contexts</h3>
<p>Although contexts are something typical working with CoreData, it&#39;s not a pattern of Realm. However we&#39;ve found a way to abstract the edition using SugarRecord contexts that have features of the CoredData ones and features of Realm too. 
As you might have noticed it allows us to work with our models using the same syntax. It means that if in a future you decide it&#39;s time to change Realm by CoreData or viceversa you have only to <strong>ensure that the new models have the same fields</strong> and you won&#39;t have to change anything around the app because the new models will have the same syntax. Yeiii!!</p>
<h2 id="migrations">Migrations</h2>
<p>It&#39;s been impossible to abstract mirations between CoreData and Realm because they are managed diferently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CoreData</strong>: In this case migrations can be either automatically managed if you specify it during the stack creation of manually managed using <strong>migration policies</strong>. I recommend you to read this post of objc.io, <a href="http://www.objc.io/issue-4/core-data-migration.html"><strong>Core Data Migration</strong></a> where they explain different migration options. In case of a failing migration, the CoreData stack automatically can notify you if you specify it. The way to do it is passing a closure to the stack:</li>
</ul>
