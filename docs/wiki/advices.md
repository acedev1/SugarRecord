## Keep in mind
- Be careful **working with objects between contexts**. In case of **CoreData** remember that a ManagedObject belongs to a given context. Once the context dies the object disappears and trying to access to it will bring you into a trouble. SugarRecord has defensive code to ensure that if you are saving objecs from one context in other one one they are automatically brought to the new context to be saved there.

- **Not referencing objects**. Try to use their remote or local identifiers instead. Strong references is something dangerous because you can break the normal behaviour of CoreData/REALM. In CoreData for example it might cause **fault relationship** crashes although your propagation rules are properly defined.
