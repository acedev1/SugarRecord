    <p><strong>Notice that the returned value is an </strong>optional<strong>, it&#39;s due to the fact that there might not be items with your criteria in the database</strong></p>
<p>The querying operation has to finish with the fetch command, <strong>find()</strong>. Don&#39;t forget it! </p>
<h2 id="edition">Edition</h2>
<p>Objects have been fetched, how do I edit them? To do it you have to remember the three simple steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Notify the object about its edition</strong></li>
<li><strong>Edit whatever you want</strong></li>
<li><strong>Notify the object that you have finished with the edition</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It&#39;s important to not forget any of the steps above or it might cause a runtime exception, especially in Realm where the notifications to the database library are crucial.</p>
